```typescript
// Smart number input with professional UX
const SmartNumberInput = ({ value, onChange }: SmartNumberInputProps) => {
  const [localValue, setLocalValue] = useState(value);

  const handleFocus = (e: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    if (value === 0 || value === "0") {
      setLocalValue(""); // Clear zeros for better UX
    }
  };

  const handleBlur = (e: React.FocusEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    if (e.target.value === "") {
      setLocalValue("0");
      onChange(0); // Default to zero if empty
    } else {
      const numValue = Number(e.target.value);
      onChange(isNaN(numValue) ? 0 : numValue);
    }
  };
};

// Real-time invoice calculations
const calculateTotals = () => {
  const subtotal = items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.total, 0);
  const tax = (subtotal * formData.taxRate) / 100;
  const total = subtotal + tax - formData.discount;
  return { subtotal, tax, total };
};

// Live PDF preview generation
